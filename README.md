# SJTU-CS420
 Homework code&report of Machine Learning lecture given by Professor Shikui Tu, Spring 2020

## Note on HW2
Please refer to [Spectural-Clustering](https://github.com/SongDark/SpectralClustering/blob/master) for detail implementations of this algorithm. Many thanks to this author. You may also find a well-decribed specturalcluster class in sklearn's official doc, and you can use it with ease as other machine learning algorithms in this package. But for me I came up with [this](https://github.com/SongDark/SpectralClustering/blob/master/) first and after I've done I realized maybe I chose the wrong way.
